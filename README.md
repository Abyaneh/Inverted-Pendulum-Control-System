# Inverted-Pendulum-Control-System
 The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory, where the goal is to design a controller to keep a pendulum upright by moving a base. This project involves modeling, simulation, and controller design to stabilize the system using Matlab and other tools. The pendulum starts at an unstable equilibrium (θ = 0) and needs to be balanced at the top (θ = 180°).
